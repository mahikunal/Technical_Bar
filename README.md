## Core Purpose: 
    The main objective is to create distinct groups (clusters or "nodes") of merchants and cardholders such that the number of interactions within a cluster is maximized, and the number of interactions between different clusters is minimized. This "no chattiness" condition means that the customer is looking for strong internal cohesion and weak external ties.

## Why is this important?
* Performance Optimization: A cluster that can process all transactions for the merchants and cardholders it is assigned, without the need to communicate with other clusters, can not only reduce latency drastically, increase throughput, but also simplify system architecture greatly.

* Data Locality: On one hand, bringing related data together can increase cache utilization. On the other hand, it can also reduce the number of distributed transactions or joins across different data stores.

* Scalability: Each cluster can potentially be deployed as an independent service or microservice, allowing for easier scaling of specific parts of the platform based on demand.

* Security/Compliance: It might simplify data isolation and access control if certain groups of users and merchants are managed within self-contained environments.


## Flow of Events (Conceptual):

* Data Ingestion: The platform picks up historical transaction records which depict the visual and semantical correlation between the cardholders and the merchants.

* Interaction Matrix/Graph Creation: Now, the data gets converted into a representation that shows the relation between the cardholders and the merchants. This may also be presented in a bipartite graph form (merchants on one side, cardholders on the other, edges representing transactions) or an adjacency matrix.

* Cluster Assignment: Based on the similarities found, the merchants and cardholders are assigned to the respective clusters.

* Deployment/Operationalization: The platform adjusts its services or resources to correspond with these clusters, thus making sure that efficient operations of the specific cluster will be mostly within the boundaries of the cluster.


## Challenges highlighted by the request:

* Generic Input: A solution is still required that can accommodate various numbers of merchants and cardholders.

* Minimizing Chattiness: This means that the strategy for partitioning should be such that it reduces the communications between different clusters as much as possible.

* Duplication: Since perfect isolation is not always possible, the problem proposes to duplicate the entities to some extent so that a more effective partitioning can be achieved. This is a frequently used compromise in distributed systems.

* Large Datasets: Given that the data "don't fit in memory," it means that the solution has to be designed in such a way that it can be scaled up; perhaps streaming and batch processing or using distributed computing frameworks as techniques can help.

### Part 1: Generic Clustering Function
* For Part 1 - a simpler heuristic. The aim is to find merchants and cardholders groups that are "tightly connected." One of the approaches could be to reformulating the problem as a graph in which weights on edges stand for the number of transactions, however, in this case, the vertices are divided into two-part the "connections" being between merchants and cardholders. We can represent the interactions as a bipartite graph. We are looking here for subgraphs where all involved merchants and cardholders are densely interconnected themselves.


## Approach for Part 1 (Initial Heuristic):
* Parse Input: Read the merchant-cardholder pairs.

* Construct Adjacency List/Sets: For every merchant, maintain the set of cardholders they've been interacting with. For every cardholder, maintain the set of merchants they've been interacting with.

* Iterative Clustering:
    - Begin with an unassigned merchant or cardholder.
    - Create a potential cluster by adding all merchants/cardholders immediately connected to the initial entity.
    - Recursively add any new cardholders/merchants associated with the members of this cluster until there are no longer any new ones associated within that growing group.
    - Label these entities as assigned and again for the next unassigned entity.
    - Refinement: After initial clusters are formed, check for "chattiness" and refine. For a simple initial approach, we'll aim for components where entities primarily interact within their found group.

### Part 2: Clustering with Strategic Duplication
Definitely the most difficult part of this work. "Strategically duplicating few merchants or card members" is the concept that we can use a certain amount of overlap between the clusters for the purpose of better separation overall. Thus, it has become a process from the strict graph partitioning to the overlapping community detection problem or a specialized cut problem.

## Approach for Part 2:
* Initial Connected Components (as in Part 1): Start by finding the naturally connected components.

* Identify "Bridge" Entities: After forming initial components, examine cardholders/merchants that interact with entities in multiple initial components. These are candidates for duplication.

* Assigning Bridges: For each bridge entity, assign it to the cluster where it has the most interactions. If it has significant interactions with another cluster, consider duplicating it. A threshold could be used (e.g., if it interacts with > X% of entities in another cluster, duplicate).

* Refine Clusters: After duplication, re-evaluate the clusters to ensure internal consistency and minimize external connections.

# We can try to "grow" clusters by adding entities that maximize internal connections and minimize external ones. Duplication occurs when an entity would significantly contribute to multiple clusters.


### Part 3: Solving for Very Large Datasets (Out-of-Memory)
* When datasets don't fit in memory, we need to employ techniques that process data in chunks or streams.

* Key Principles for Large Datasets:
    * Batch Processing/Streaming: Read data in small batches, process them, and write intermediate results.
    * Distributed Data Structures (Conceptual): Instead of defaultdict(set), we can think about the efficent approach to store these mappings if they were on disk or across multiple machines (e.g., a simple key-value store or a database).
    * Iterative Refinement: Algorithms often involve multiple passes over the data.
    * No In-Memory Graph Representation: We cannot build the full cardholder_to_merchants and merchant_to_cardholders dictionaries entirely in memory.

## Modified Approach for Part 3:
The core idea for out-of-memory processing is to avoid loading the entire graph into RAM. We'll simulate this by:

1. Reading in Batches: Process the input file line by line or in small chunks.

2. External Storage (Simulated with Files): Instead of Python dicts, imagine using temporary files or a simple on-disk key-value store (like shelve or a custom file-based approach) to store interaction data.

3. Iterative Clustering (MapReduce style conceptualization):
    * Pass 1 (Build Adjacency Lists/Counts): Read the input file and generate "adjacency list" data for each entity, but write it to temporary files.
        * C1 -> M6, M8 (stored as C1\tM6,M8 in cardholder_adj.tmp)
        * M6 -> C1, C6 (stored as M6\tC1,C6 in merchant_adj.tmp)

    * Pass 2 (Initial Clustering):
        * This is the hardest part. You can't do a full DFS/BFS across an out-of-memory graph easily.
        * Heuristic for Large Scale: Instead of a single connected components pass, a common approach for large graphs is to use a variation of label propagation or a hash-based partitioning.
        * Simplified Large Scale Heuristic:
            * Assign a unique cluster ID to each merchant and cardholder initially.
            * Iterate many times: for each entity, re-assign its cluster ID to the ID of the cluster that most of its neighbors belong to. This slowly converges.
            * For our problem, since we have a bipartite graph, it's slightly different.

# Simplified Iterative Approach for Part 3 (File-Based Simulation):
1. Generate Intermediate Files: Create files mapping cardholder -> [merchants] and merchant -> [cardholders]. These would be large, but each line is self-contained.

2. Iterative Pass with Label Propagation (Simulated):
    * Start by assigning each unique merchant and cardholder to its own "tentative" cluster ID (e.g., M1 gets cluster ID M1_id, C1 gets C1_id). Store these mappings in a file (entity_cluster_mapping.tmp).
    * Iteration Loop (e.g., 5-10 times):
    * For each record in the original transaction file: (C_i, M_j)
        * Look up C_i's current cluster ID (CID_i) and M_j's current cluster ID (MID_j) from entity_cluster_mapping.tmp.
        * If CID_i â‰  MID_j, then one of them "ought" to belong to the other's cluster. One rule might be: the smaller cluster joins the big one, or they both join a new shared ID. A better rule: bump vote for each cluster ID from neighbors.
        * Gather Votes: For every cardholder, loop over its merchants. Get votes for (cardholder, suggested_cluster_id) from merchant's current cluster. Do the same thing for merchants.
        * Summarize Votes and Update Cluster IDs: For every entity, select the cluster ID that was most voted for by its neighbors. Generate a new entity_cluster_mapping_next_iter.tmp file.
        * Update old mapping file with new one.
    * This is a very simplified Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA). It is fast but non-deterministic and tends to have convergence problems on certain graphs.

3. Final Output Collection: The cluster IDs should eventually settle (or fluctuate). Cluster entities by their final cluster ID.
